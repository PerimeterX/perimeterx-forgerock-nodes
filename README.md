# PerimeterX Authentication Nodes

PerimeterX Bot Defender nodes for [Identity Platform][forgerock_platform] 7.1.0 and above. Combined, the nodes handle the PerimeterX request verification process and the display of the challenge page.

## Installation

Copy the .jar files from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed. Restart the web container to pick up the new node. The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.

## Usage

Drag the node to your journey and connect it after the Data Store Decision node. Connect the `true` output to your success node and the `false` output to the **pxChallengeNode** in order to show the challenge page for a blocked request. Finally, connect **pxChallengeNode** to the red X:

Make sure to fill in the required node properties for the **pxVerificationNode** node. You can find all the required data on the [PerimeterX Console](https://console.perimeterx.com).

When a request gets blocked, the default challenge page will be shown, as follows:
